# TypeScriptPractice

Why TypeScript?

It provides static type checking, through which we get to learn about potential bugs as we are typing code,
than heading to browser and figuring out the bug at runtime.
Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation.
Make maintenance and refactoring of large code base much easier

Installation

How to run?
Create file with extension .ts
Write code
Go to terminal and write "tsc filenmae.ts"
This command will create a file having .js extension having converted typescript code in plain javascript
